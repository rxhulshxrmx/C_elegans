## What We Built: A Computational Neuroscience Research Pipeline

This project implements a complete research platform for studying neural network learning in C. elegans sensorimotor control. Here's the full lifecycle of what we're doing:

## 1. BIOLOGICAL FOUNDATION

**C. elegans (Roundworm)**
- Model organism with exactly 302 neurons
- Well-mapped connectome (neural wiring diagram)  
- Simple but rich behaviors: swimming, chemotaxis, navigation
- Perfect for computational modeling due to simplicity and completeness

## 2. DIGITAL TWIN COMPONENTS

### A. MuJoCo Physics Simulation (`mujoco_viewer.py`)

**What it does:**
- Creates realistic 3D physics simulation of C. elegans swimming
- Models worm as 25 connected body segments with joints and actuators
- Simulates fluid dynamics, body mechanics, and sensory inputs
- Provides visual real-time simulation with dark theme

**Two simulation modes:**
1. **Full C. elegans (25 segments)**: Complete biomechanical model with chemotaxis
2. **Simple swimmer (3 segments)**: Minimal model for basic locomotion testing

**Key features:**

- Chemotaxis behavior (navigation toward reward)
- Quantified metrics (distance, concentration, position tracking)
- Interactive camera controls

### B. Neural Network Training Platform

#### `simple_rnn_demo.py` - Core Research Engine

**What it does:**
1. **Task Creation**: Generates navigation tasks in 1D and 3D environments
2. **RNN Training**: Trains recurrent neural networks to control worm movement
3. **Weight Extraction**: Captures all network weights before and after training
4. **Analysis**: Quantifies how learning changes the neural structure

**Training Process:**
```
Initial RNN → Navigation Task → Training → Final RNN
     ↓              ↓             ↓          ↓
Extract weights → Learn optimal → Update → Extract weights
                  movements      weights
```

**Learning Task:**
- **Input**: Current position + distance to target
